This project contains the Maple package/module "ATensor" designed to evaluate the divergence of a particular rank 2 tensor field in two dimensions.

"SimpleATensor" contains the barebones package, with no support for the scalar fields P and Q.

(Depreceated) "ATensor" is a more feature rich version of the package. It contains additional commands involving P and Q but lacks the ability to process P and Q as arbitrary functions. "ATensor" is also less performative than "SimpleATensor".

"Simplified Order 5 Proof.mw" is a Maple worksheet that computes DivA using an arbitrary conformal Lorentz metric, with P(R,S) and Q(R) as arbitrary functions.
